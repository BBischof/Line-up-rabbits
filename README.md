# Line-up-rabbits

## Problem

Given $n$ rabbits of different heights, how many ways can we put them into a line such that we see $l$ from the left, and $r$ from the right.

## Usage

For recursive solution: 
```
python rabbitsRecursion.py n l r
```
where n, l, and r are the integers above. I assume l, r >=1 since otherwise the solution is zero. I also assume that n >= l+r because again otherwise the solution is zero.
